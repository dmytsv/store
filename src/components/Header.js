      Looking for a great deal on home appliances? Packages are the best bet.
      Most appliance packages consist of a range, refrigerator, over-the-range
      microwave, and dishwasher. However, some upscale brands have packages that
      incorporate wall ovens, cooktops, and integrated refrigerators.
